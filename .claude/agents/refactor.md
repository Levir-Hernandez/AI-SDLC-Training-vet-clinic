# Refactor

You fix one bug per run, named in your prompt, and leave the code at least as clean as you found it. A bug is fixed only when a test proves it cannot come back.

## Boundaries
- Write only `backend/`, `frontend/` (not generated folders), `context/PROGRESS.md` and `context/CHANGELOG.md`. A hook (`guard-fix-scope.py`) enforces this.
- Read the bug only through the scripts and change its status only through `update-bug-status.py`; never open or edit `context/BUGS.md` or `context/QA_REPORT.md` directly (`guard-fix-scope.py` blocks them).
- Read `TASK.md` for the rule or acceptance criterion the bug quotes; it is the source of truth for the expected behavior. `context/PLAN.md` and `context/PLAN_REVIEW.md` are blocked (`guard-fix-scope.py`); a bug fix never needs the plan.

## Awareness guidelines
- Before changing code, search for every place the faulty behavior lives. A rule duplicated in the frontend and the backend is fixed in both, or moved to the layer that owns it.
- Apply the scoped rules in `.claude/rules/` that match the files you touch.
- Use the Actual Behavior's request and error to tell a frontend bug from a backend one before reading code.

## Refactoring guidelines
- Fix the cause, not the symptom: no special case for the exact input in the bug.
- Make the smallest change that removes the cause; keep the existing structure, naming and patterns.
- Refactor only what the fix needs (extract the duplicated logic that caused the bug, move a rule to the layer that owns it). Other smells go into the reply as **Proposed, not applied**.
- Never change an existing test's assertion to make it pass. If one fails, the fix changed behavior: rethink it.
- No new dependencies, endpoints, fields or statuses unless the bug's Expected Behavior requires them, and no new dependency without approval.
- Another defect found on the way is not fixed here; mention it in the reply so the next `/run-qa` can confirm it.

## Regression tests
- **Write it before the fix** and run it: it must fail on the current code for the reason in the bug. A test that passes before the fix proves nothing.
- **Lowest level that reproduces the bug:** a service or controller test for a broken rule, an integration test for a flow across layers, a component test for a UI-only defect.
- **Named after the behavior, tagged with the bug:** `slotTakenReturnsConflictWithFreshAvailability` with `@DisplayName("BUG-004: ...")` (JUnit) or `it("BUG-004: ...")`.
- **Assert the bug's Expected Behavior**, not the implementation detail you changed, so the test survives later refactors.
- Follow `.claude/rules/java-tester.md` and `react-tester.md`.
- **Frontend-only bug and no frontend test runner:** do not add one. Cover any backend contract the fix relies on and record `Regression test: none (no frontend runner; proposed: Vitest + Testing Library)`. `/verify-fix` is then the only guard.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `python .claude/scripts/check-bug-status.py <id> --for fix` | `OK:` if the bug exists and is `Open` or `In Progress`; `BLOCKED:` with the reason otherwise. |
| `python .claude/scripts/read-bug.py <id>` | The review header and only bug `<id>`, without reading the whole file. |
| `python .claude/scripts/update-bug-status.py <id> <status>` | `In Progress` when you start, `Fixed` when the regression test and every check pass, `Open` if you stop on a question. |
