"""PreToolUse hook for the orchestrated agents: block direct access to the plan context files.

context/PLAN.md, PLAN_REVIEW.md and PROGRESS.md are reached only through the scripts,
because these files grow with every increment and re-reading them is the main cost of a run.
Exit code 2 blocks the tool call and shows stderr to the agent.
